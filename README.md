## What are we gonna do?

We are going to build a awsome Star Wars app, in which you can see all the characters in the saga and their characteristics!

  

### Built With

  **I have chosen to code with:** 

- JavaScript as main technology 
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) as my framework 
- Sass for the styling 
- [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/)
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) for my personal challenge because is my first time using this awsome technology

  
 


## Before you start:

1. You must have npm installed and the npm packages that are listed on the installation section.

  

## Installation and set up

  

1. Clone the repository or download in a zip version.

```sh

git clone https://github.com/nathaliachn/Ravn-Challenge-V2-Nathalia-Chavez.git

```

2. Install NPM packages

```sh

npm install react @apollo/react-hooks apollo-boost graphql graphql-tag normalize.css react-apollo 
and node-sass

```

 

## Running instructions

  

1.- When we open the web app and everything goes fine with the API, we will see an screen like this in out desktop computer or laptop.

<br/>

<br/>

<br/>

3.- This little program is powered by an awesome third party; therefore, if we see a messa like this one is because of the API was deprecated or it's in maintenance.
